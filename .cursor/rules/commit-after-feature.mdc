# Commit After Feature

When you finish implementing a feature (or a logical, complete unit of work):

1. **Stage** the relevant changes: `git add` the files you created or modified.
2. **Commit** with a clear, present-tense message that describes what was done, e.g.:
   - "Add user login endpoint"
   - "Implement dark mode toggle in settings"
   - "Fix null check in payment validation"

Do not batch unrelated changes into one commit. One feature or fix per commit.
